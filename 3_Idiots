## Movie Review of 3 idiots ##
Written and directed by Rajkumar Hirani, whose two previous films also tweaked Indian sensibilities with great commercial and critical success, "3 Idiots" dominated at the boxoffice. In India, the Reliance Big Pictures release collected more than 1 billion rupees ($21.3 million) in its first four days of release.

The film's good points, though, are marred by a slow start and a nerve-jangling soundtrack (except for the charming "Aal Izz Well"). Perceptive, subtle acting work by Khan, Madhavan and Joshi also clashes with buffoonish performances by Omi Vaidya, as an odious school rival, and veteran character actor Irani, whose character is cursed with an unnecessary -- and unfunny -- lisp.
