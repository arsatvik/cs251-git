## Movie Review of 3 idiots ##
Written and directed by Rajkumar Hirani, whose two previous films also tweaked Indian sensibilities with great commercial and critical success, "3 Idiots" dominated at the boxoffice. In India, the Reliance Big Pictures release collected more than 1 billion rupees ($21.3 million) in its first four days of release.

A great part of the film's appeal is Aamir Khan, who has come to specialize in heroic iconoclasts, such as a rebellious villager in "Lagaan" or a visionary teacher of special-needs kids in "Taare Zameen Par." As Rancho, a young engineer of dazzling inventiveness, Khan conveys smarts, mischief and, finally, compassion, as he spurs his friends on to greatness before he mysteriously disappears.
